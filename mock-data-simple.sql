-- Simple Mock Data for Likey Social Media Platform
-- This creates posts and content using your existing user profile

-- First, let's get your current user ID (replace this with your actual user ID from profiles table)
-- You can find your user ID by running: SELECT id FROM profiles LIMIT 1;

-- Create some sample posts from your account to populate the feed
-- Replace 'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE' with your actual user ID from the profiles table
